To do list Josine: 09/06/2015:

QC report
1) add threshold line to discriminate sexes to sex graph based on qc parameters
2) add slide colors to meth/unmeth plot
3) cell count plot is not appropriate for 5000 samples
4) control probe means plots are too small and should be colored by slide
5) sex mismatches and genotype discordant samples are missing in summary report
6) rename figure dir to same prefix as .html files

Normalization report 
1) association between PCs and batch variables. Batch variables should be factors. Boxplots of pvalues rather than betas.
2) PCA plot of normalized data to detect outliers.




handle additional technical effects in meffil.normalize.objects()
 - new arguments: fixed.effects, random.effects, adjust.slide=T/F
 - if (adjust.slide) add slide to random.effects
 - regress out fixed and random effects from the design matrix
 - add fixed and random effects to main regression



create a qc plot that just uses hierarchical clustering of the samples?
 d <- dist(as.matrix(t(norm.beta)))
 hc<-hclust(d)
 pdf("dendrogram_pc10.pdf",height=6,width=8)
 par(cex=0.3, mar=c(5, 8, 4, 1))
 plot(hc)
 dev.off()



In normalization-reports.r, change batch plots and analysis
so that each batch is shown for each pc component?  
Right now we just see how associated the batches are as a group to each pc component.
This doesn't allow us to identify potentially problematic batches ...
  options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
  ## set reference as grand mean across all levels rather than a single factor level
  try(res[i,j] <- coefficients(summary(lm(pcs[,j] ~ dat[,i])))[2,4], silent=TRUE)







Josine comments on normalization report (May 19, 2015):

I had a look at the normalization report for the cell lines
(attached). I have some comments the report. My first comment relates
to the association between PC and batch var. :

It is currently coded as: try(res[i, j] <-
coefficients(summary(lm(pcs[, j] ~ dat[, i])))[2, 4]

Your batch variable should be calculated as a factor and not as a
numeric variable. As for most of the batches you have a lot of levels
with a few samples so you need to set the reference as the grand mean
across all levels of your factor which is different from the default
which set the first level as reference.

The plots should be showing association for each level rather than one
pvalue for each batch as one PC might be associated with one specific
plate.

Just to check, are the associations calculated on the raw PCs
extracted from the control matrix and not not on the design matrix
which is scaled and winsorized?

pdf(paste("pca.controlmatrix_lm.pdf",sep=""),height=6,width=6)
for (b in 1:length(batch)){
m<-match(batch[b],names(manifestdata))
manifestdata[,m]<-as.factor(manifestdata[,m]) #set batch as a factor
batch.out<-data.frame()    
for (pcomp in 1:dim(control.matrix)[1]){
options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly")) #set reference as grand mean across all levels
r1<-summary(lm(control.components$x[,pcomp]~1+manifestdata[,m]))
batch.out<-rbind(batch.out,data.frame(pc=pcomp,f=levels(manifestdata[,m]),r1$coefficients))
pca.pc<-control.components$x[,pcomp]
boxplot(pca.pc~manifestdata[,m],main=paste("PC",pcomp,".",batch[b],sep=""),cex.names=0.5,las=2) #boxplot for each level of each batch
write.table(batch.out,paste("controlmatrix_pca_lm.",batch[b],".txt",sep=""),col.names=T,row.names=F,sep="\t",quote=F)
}
}
dev.off()

In addition it would be good to do a PCA plot or dendogram on all
samples to look for outliers. For the cell line data (143 samples) the
dendogram was very clear as you can directly label your samples. Not
sure if it is easy to see in 5000 samples. Here is some code for these
plots.

dendogram or PCA plot
d <- dist(as.matrix(t(norm.beta)))
hc<-hclust(d)
pdf(paste("dendrogram_pc",pc,".pdf",height=6,width=8)
par(cex=0.3, mar=c(5, 8, 4, 1))
plot(hc)
dev.off()

PCA plot:
 plotPCA <- function(pca, pc1, pc2, col, covariates, selectedCov, bty="o"){
    pheno.col=as.numeric(as.factor(covariates[,match(selectedCov,colnames(covariates))]))
    colors <- c("#4477AA","#CC6677","#DDCC77","#117733","#88CCEE","#AA4499","#44AA99","#999933","#882255","#661100","#6699CC","#AA4466")
    if(length(unique(pheno.col))>length(colors)){colors=rainbow(length(unique(pheno.col)))}
    
    u.pheno.col<-data.frame(unique(pheno.col),colors[1:length(unique(pheno.col))])
    m<-match(pheno.col,u.pheno.col[,1])
    col<-u.pheno.col[m,2]
    xMin <- min(pca[,as.numeric(pc1)])
    xMax <- max(pca[,as.numeric(pc1)])
    xRange <- xMax - xMin
    xlim <- c(xMin-0.05*xRange, xMax+0.20*xRange)
    xlab <- paste("PC",as.numeric(pc1), " scores", sep="")
    ylab <- paste("PC",as.numeric(pc2), " scores", sep="")
    

    plot(pca[,as.numeric(pc1)], pca[,as.numeric(pc2)],
         col = col, pch = 18, cex = 2, xlab = xlab,
         ylab = ylab, xlim = xlim,
         main = "Principal component analysis (PCA)",
         cex.main = 1.0, cex.lab = 1.0, bty = bty)
    
    uColor <- unique(col)
    uCov   <- unique(covariates[,match(selectedCov, colnames(covariates))])
    
    legend("topright", legend = uCov, pch = 18, col = uColor,
           cex = 0.8, title = selectedCov, bty = "n")
    grid()
}









Josine comments on the qc reports (May 11, 2015):

General:
i) Could you rename the folder "figure" to "meffil_qc_plots_yy_mm_dd"
ii) Could the default detection score p be set to 0.01?
iii) Could the default sample failure rate set to be 0.20?

Sex graph: 
Could we change this plot to the shinymethyl version which is much more clear?
i) Report says there are 3 sex detection outliers but plot doesn't show which samples are outliers
ii)"Sex not specified" has same symbol as females. I also don't understand what correct prediction means
iii) It would be great if we could add a dashed vertical line for the "sex.cutoff" used for the prediction to discriminate males and females. 
iv) Could we color males and females?

Meth-unmeth graph
i) what does the red and blue line mean? Could you add legend?
ii) Can we color samples by slide or plate so we can identify possible dyebias?

Controlmeans:
i) These plots are not readable if you have a lot of samples. There are too many plots on one page.
ii) It is really important here to order and color by plate/slide as it is a way to detect specific plate/slide issues such as dyebias.

cpg-detectionp-graph:
i) ChrY needs fixing. For females, chrY should be ignored.
ii) Could you make the plot wider, so you can see possible spikes of poor detected regions better?
ii) Could you add chromosome number to the x-axis rather than on top?
iii) Could you add a horizontal dashed line with the failure threshold?

cpg-beadnum-graph:
i) Could you set default threshold to 0.2? 
ii) Could you make the plot wider, so you can see possible spikes of poor detected regions better?
ii) Could you add chromosome number to the x-axis rather than on top?

cell-counts-beta
i) x-axis labels are unreadable, maybe use a darker color. Could you give a different color for each reference bar?
ii) what is the horizontal line?

cell-counts-estimate:
i) x-axis labels are unreadable, could you use a darker color.

In the report:

i) Sex mismatches: " There are 3 sex detection outliers, and 0 sex detection mismatches." What are sex detection mismatches?? Could we add column with outlier FALSE/TRUE here?
 "This is a plot of the xy.diff values estimated from the methylation data." Could you change it to median differences between Y and X intensities.

ii) Methylated vs unmethylated: What does colour.code mean? Can you remove this?


iii) Control probe means: What does colour code and id mean? Plate might be good to add. "There were 18 outliers detected based on deviations from mean values for control probes." How many deviations? I wouldn't remove all these outliers. I would only look at dyebias outliers here. So only include oob.ratio/dyebias outliers. So change outliers TRUE/FALSE column.

iv)Sample detection p-values: There were 7 outliers detected based on having high detection p-values. Could you add failure rate here? What does colour code and id mean? Plate might be good to add. Could the default be set to 20%.

v) Sample bead numbers. There were 0 outliers detected based on having low average bead numbers. Could you change it to There were 0 outliers detected based on having low average bead numbers (<3)

vi) CpG detection p-values: Black horizontal line represents threshold of 0.05. Could you change it to 0.2?

v) CpG low bead numbers. Could you change title to "Low number of beads per CpG".
