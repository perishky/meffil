handle additional technical effects in meffil.normalize.objects()
 - new arguments: fixed.effects, random.effects, adjust.slide=T/F
 - if (adjust.slide) add slide to random.effects
 - regress out fixed and random effects from the design matrix
 - add fixed and random effects to main regression

create a qc plot that just uses hierarchical clustering of the samples?
 d <- dist(as.matrix(t(norm.beta)))
 hc<-hclust(d)
 pdf("dendrogram_pc10.pdf",height=6,width=8)
 par(cex=0.3, mar=c(5, 8, 4, 1))
 plot(hc)
 dev.off()

In normalization-reports.r, change batch plots and analysis
so that each batch is shown for each pc component?  
Right now we just see how associated the batches are as a group to each pc component.
This doesn't allow us to identify potentially problematic batches ...
  options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
  ## set reference as grand mean across all levels rather than a single factor level
  try(res[i,j] <- coefficients(summary(lm(pcs[,j] ~ dat[,i])))[2,4], silent=TRUE)
