Cell counts were estimated using the `r qc.summary$cell.counts$reference` cell type methylation profile references.

Plot compares methylation levels of CpG sites used to estimate cellular composition
for each sample and reference methylation profile.
Methylation levels of samples should generally overlap with reference methylation levels
otherwise estimation will have simply selected the cell type reference
with the nearest mean methylation level.

Boxplot shows the distributions of estimated cellular composition for each reference cell type across all samples.
